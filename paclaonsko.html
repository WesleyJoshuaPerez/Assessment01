                    In the covid pandemic I rarely or can't go out the house<br>
                    because of the lockdown. For that reason  that i gain weight<br>
                    a lot of weight. It was sad times that makes me overthink<br>
                    during those times. That also makes me study online during those two years.<br>
                    I gain a lot of motivation when lockdown has been lifted.<br>
