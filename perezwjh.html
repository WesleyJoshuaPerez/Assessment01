        <p>I am Wesley Joshua H. Perez 20 years old from Bilolo Orion Bataan, I graduated Senior  <br>
            high at Justice Emilio Gancayco Memorial Highschool. I am a dedicated student at <br>
            Bataan Peninsula State University Main Campus, I have always been curious about how <br>
            technology works and how is the process of creation of the applications. This led me to <br>
            pursue a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Major in Network <br>
            and Web Application. I am always to eager to expand my knowledge through both <br>
            academic and practical experiences in It industries.

        When I was a little, I was fascinated about technologies like i want to learn how its work and how <br>
        the applications are created. This led to me towards the word of programming. Over the years in <br>
        this university I have developed strong interest in web development like backend and database <br>
        management like how sql works. I enjoy working on the projects that challenge me to think <br>
        critically on how can i implement its functionality and apply it in my websites. My goal is to <br>
        graduate in this university and help my family.

    I also like body building and cycling. During my free time, I would rather visit the gym or cycle for <br>
    improved physical health. I also spend some time learning some new programming language like <br>
    php or frameworks like bootstrap for css. These activities not only allow me to unwind, but it may <br>
    also help me to learn some useful skills that i can practice while learning. Physical and mental <br>
    exercise keeps me on my balanced way of life.

  <!--Fourth paragraph-->
  <p>
    When finding a team in group work, I highly value the teamwork and collaboration of each <br>
    member. During our baby thesis we face some challenges in building a website, but we overcome <br>
    it with the power of teamwork and time management. These challenges helped me to be able to <br>
    learn some new things and new ways to improve myself. Working in a group has taught me how <br>
    to manage my time effectively and be open to different perspective. I am very lucky that I have a <br>
    groupmate that are hardworking and talented.

        HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and PHP. And i want to be able to improve my skill in coding by <br>
        working on projects that involve both front-end and back-end development. My goal is to <br>
