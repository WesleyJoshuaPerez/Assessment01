    <p>
        My name is <b>Troy Francis Navales Mendoza</b>. I was born in September 9, 2004 at Olongapo City, Zambales <br>
        and currently 20 years of age. I am currently at my third year of college majoring in Information Technology <br>
        specializing on Network and Web Application. From my chosen field of study, I excel on front-end development, <br>
        graphics design and networking. My interests includes watching movies, reading books, designing digital posters <br>
        and I am also pretty good at writing critiques, essays and screenplays.

  <p>
    My family bought a land, built a house and relocated from Zambales to Bulacan when I was growing up due to my <br>
    father's diligence and hard work abroad. My mother is named Jimmelyn Mendoza and she was born and bred in Olongapo City as well. <br>
    She is currently handling a business in our home. My father is named Jayson Mendoza and he was born and bred in Bulacan. <br>
    He has 2 brothers and 7 sisters. He is currently working as a cashier in Toronto, Canada. I have one sister named Chloe <br>
    and she is currently studying at a high school back in my hometown.

        When I was born, I was diagnosed with a heart condition which I fortunately grew out of as I enter toddlerhood. <br>
        During my elementary days, I am usually asthmatic—partly due to my heart condition—so I was barred from engaging <br>
        in rigorous physical activities like playing with my schoolmates after school. But at this time, I discovered my <br>
        passion for books and writing so even though I do not have a lot friends, I usually pass time by reading and my <br>
        teachers started noticing my proficiency in the English language so they started sending me to journalism competitions. <br>
        I won first place at a feature writing contest when I was in sixth grade and my mother has never been so proud of me.

    I studied at a national high school in Bulacan and I am a consistent honor student. During my senior high school, <br>
    the COVID-19 pandemic happened forcing me, my mother and my sister to temporarily move to Bataan in search for a <br>
    job so I graduated high school altogether here in Orion, Bataan back in July 2022. I was originally going to pursue <br>
    a writing major but they do not offer anything relative to it here in BPSU so I took Information Technology instead. <br>
    On my freshman year, I had a hard time adjusting to the environment because college is so far different from high <br>
    school but I ended up knowing and befriending a lot of interesting, talented and nice people. But in 2023, <br>
    in my second year of college, my mother and sister had to go back in Bulacan because my father got a job offer <br>
    in Toronto, Canada. I had to stay in Bataan and live with my uncle's house until I finish college.

    <p>
        Back in 2020, I started watching a lot of movies because we're all stuck at home and I don't really have anything much going on. <br>
        I completely fell in love with the art of filmmaking so it is a dream of mine to visit Hollywood until I have saved enough. <br>
        My favorite filmmakers includes Éric Rohmer, Charlie Kaufman, Martin Scorsese, Gregg Araki, Luca Guadagnino, Hayao Miyazaki <br>
        and David Fincher. Fincher's 2010 biopic called "The Social Network" is very influential to me and is the film that made me <br>
        consider taking a computer-related course in college because I thought making websites and programming was cool.
