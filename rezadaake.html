    <h3>Angeline Kate E. Rezada</h3>
    <!--First paragraph-->
    <p>I am Angeline Kate E. Rezada, 21  years old, and is residing in Roosevelt, Dinalupihan, Bataan.

    </p>
    <!--Second paragraph-->
    <p>
        I am currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, a 3rd year student at Bataan
        Peninsula State University. When I was in Senior High School, I am actually undecided on what course to 
        take on college, I being in this field now was slightly urged by my father. But nonetheless, I also
        love exploring technology and what I am looking forward to learn now and in the future is anything about networking engineering.
        But right now, I just wish that this field that I took would bring me to a place where I would feel comfortable, contented,
        and excited on more things. I will be enthusiast to be learn more, explore more, and meet a lot of people who 
        will be my instrument to become better and excel in my chosen field. 
    </p>
    <!--Third paragraph-->
    <p>
        In terms of other lighter things in life, I am excited to share that I have two guinea pigs. They are Koko
        and Arki, they will turn 1 yr old this February 26, I really love taking care of them. I also love cats, in our house
        in Manila, we have three cats namely Uno, Thirdy, and Whiskas. Even though it is a bit of a work to take care of pet, I highly 
        value their presence and their impact on my well-being. When I am stressed out I just snuggle my pets and after that I will
        feel more energetic on things. The only one thing that is currently and will forever make me overthink will be when they would
        have to cross that bridge in the future.
    </p>
    <!--Fourth paragraph-->
    <p>
        I also love watching anime, K-Drama, and hollywood series on  my free time. I  cook our meals, I sometimes clean the house, I also love 
        cleaning the outside of our house, like some bushes and excess dried plants on the ground. I love listening to music, I actually
        listen every time I go to sleep and when I wake up, it really calms me down. On a normal day in our house, things 
        that I usually do is watching, doing my academic tasks, organization tasks, listening to music, cleaning, and feeding my pets. It's not 
        much but I can say that I am a little contented on what I do now. 
    </p>
    <!--Fifth paragraph-->
    <p>
        In terms on personal growth on this field, I would really love to have many opportunities as much as possible. I want to grow and acquire 
        more knowledge on this field and even if I am contented on what I do now, I still always believe that I should focus on expanding 
        my knowledge. And of course,  I wanted to this with the support of one of the things that keeps me going, my family. In the future, I would 
        really love to share with them the things that I would achieve and knowledge that I acquired in this journey. Lastly, I hope I can give them 
        the best of what I can give, I hope that when the time comes that I am able to afford the things or places that we dreamed of, they'll still be there,
        clapping and celebrating with me.
